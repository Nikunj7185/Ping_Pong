# Ping Pong Game

This is a computer vision-based ping pong game that allows players to control the paddle using hand gestures detected via a webcam. The game uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and custom mechanics implemented in Python.

## Features
- Control the paddle using real-time hand gesture recognition through a webcam.
- Play against a computer-controlled opponent.
- Displays a game-over screen with win/lose messages.
- Dynamic ball movement and collision detection.
  
## Installation
To install and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ping-pong-game
Install the required dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the game:

```bash
python game.py
```
## Usage
Ensure your webcam is connected, as the game relies on hand tracking to control the paddle.
The paddle moves in the vertical direction based on the position of your hand detected by the camera.
The ball bounces between the two paddles (player and computer) until a player misses, resulting in a win/loss.
Project Structure
img/
Contains image assets used for paddles and ball.

package/
Contains the game mechanics code including ball, player, and computer logic.

game.py
The main game file that initializes the webcam feed, handles hand detection using MediaPipe, and runs the game loop.

requirements.txt

Technologies Used
OpenCV: For video capture and real-time frame processing.
MediaPipe: For hand detection and tracking.
cvzone: For easy overlaying of images (paddle, ball) on the video feed.
NumPy: For handling image arrays and matrix operations.
Future Enhancements
Add a score counter to track the number of successful hits.
Implement different levels of difficulty for the computer-controlled opponent.
Enhance the user interface with more interactive game-over screens.
Add multiplayer functionality over a network.
